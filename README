the json config file works the same for all the softwares in this directory.

csv2influx.r <json config file>: this software will take whatever new files it can find in  the Tank,
                                 process them and push them  into the Influx  database. It's the main
								 software for updating the database with new data.

ref2db.r <json config file>: it searches for reference data file and push them into Influx. It's used
                             by the 'tickdb' R package, for example, to find  which products  we have
							 in the database, know about their properties, like  tick size  or expiry
							 date.
