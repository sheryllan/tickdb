===============================================================================
This is where I document the design and development of the storage system. 
While it is for the tickdata system, it will be flexible enough to be used
in other situations where multi-tiered storage is needed. 


System overview:

* FreeBSD based
* ZFS Filesystem
* Direct Attached Storage Units  (for now we are using a Fujitsu SAN)


Additionally, for the tickdata stuff, we will be doing some file processing
on the head-unit (assuming we can get it working). If not, then we will have
a seperate "processing box" for it.
