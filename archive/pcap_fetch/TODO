Here I write things that are currently broken, that need to be done, or that are left ambiguous 

1. What should be done if a bzipped PCAP file cannot be unzipped? For now we do nothing else but report it.
   How much do we care if one file is corrupt out of the batch?

2. Implement cleanup() function, so that if we are interrupted, we don't leave droppings everywhere
