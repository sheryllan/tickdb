Does what it says on the tin. 

This program will be run by cron daily, and will iterate through a list of key:value pairs in the following format:

	"hostname":"path"

within the path, we will have the following structure:
	/var/reactor/pcaps/EMDI/
	/var/reactor/pcaps/ETI/

It will save the path into the following:
	write everything to /storage/scratchdisk/$hostname/$start_of_transfer_timestamp

then:
	1. bunzip files (if necessary) and move to  /storage/P2D/raw_pcaps/$hostname/$timestamp/...
	2. Merge pcaps into A.cap and B.pcap in /storage/P2D/merged_pcaps/$hostname/$timestamp/

# User/system permissions

This script will be ran as the pcapdump user. It will connect to the target as the pcapdump user. This user will be in the "pcap" group on both
ends. The pulls will happen via a passwordless ssh-key which will be stored on the server (and only there).

# Exit codes

* fetch_pcaps.py:
	* exit code 0 = program completed, no errors
	* exit code 1 = program completed, with errors, please check logs and see if you care
	* exit code >1 = We had a serious error, cannot continue. Return code depends on called program


# ===================================================================================

WORKFLOW:

1. run pcap_dumps.py.  If exit 0 then continue, otherwise investigate
2. run parallel_pcap_merge.py. If exit 0 then continue, otherwise investigate
