This script is to import qtg name to reactor name mapping data into influx.

Mapping data is generated based on qtg instrument file.

One example of qtg instrument name is GXU8_Index. this script gets the 'GX' part, and maps it to 'FDAX' which
is from 'trading' column in qtg instrument file.

Special_Reactor_Name in the script can be modified to map 'GX' to a different name. for instance, adding 'GX' : 'DAX' in 
Special_Reactor_Name can map 'GX' to 'DAX' 

Usage of this script:

Python parse_qtg_inst.py <qtg instrument file> <influx http host> <influx http port> <influx db name>
