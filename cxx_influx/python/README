parse_qtg_inst.py is to import qtg name to reactor name mapping data into influx.

Mapping data is generated based on qtg instrument file.

One example of qtg instrument name is GXU8_Index. this script gets the 'GX' part, and maps it to 'FDAX' which
is from 'trading' column in qtg instrument file.

Special_Reactor_Name in the script can be modified to map 'GX' to a different name. for instance, adding 'GX' : 'DAX' in 
Special_Reactor_Name can map 'GX' to 'DAX' 

Usage of this script:

Python parse_qtg_inst.py <qtg instrument file> <influx http host> <influx http port> <influx db name>

validation.py is used to validate if data in influx is the same as the data in a mdrecorder file. python3 is required to run this script.
this script takes following steps to do verification.
 1. loads mdrecorder file first 
 2. query data from influx based on information such as product, time range, product type, expiry from the mdrecorder file. 
 3. compare data in mdrecorder file with data from influx
 4. quits if there is any mismatch found.

Please be noted that this script may consume a lot of memory as one mdrecorder file's data could be in GB.

Usage of validation.py, the last two arguments are optional. if not set, this script checks all records in a mdrecorder file.

  python3 validation.py <http host> <http port> <influx_db> <files that contains paths to multiple mdrecorder files, one file per line> <check at most N of books> <check at most N of trades>
  python3 validation.py <http host> <http port> <influx_db> -s <one single mdrecorder file> <check at most N of books> <check at most N of trades>
