Does what it says on the tin. 

This program will be run by cron daily, and will iterate through a list of key:value pairs in the following format:

	"hostname":"path"

within the path, we will have the following structure:
	/var/reactor/pcaps/EMDI/
	/var/reactor/pcaps/ETI/

It will save the path into the following:
    $hostname/$second_timestamp/

write everything to /storage/scratchdisk/$hostname/$start_of_transfer_timestamp
then:
	1. bunzip files (if necessary)
	2. open each file to denote start of PCAP time (or alternatively, look at ctime/mtime  (make sure rsync has preserve-time set)
	3. rename file into the following format: $start_timestamp.(ETI/EMDI).pcap
	4. move to final destination /storage/P2D

# User/system permissions

This script will be ran as the pcapdump user. It will connect to the target as the pcapdump user. This user will be in the "pcap" group on both
ends. The pulls will happen via a passwordless ssh-key which will be stored on the server (and only there).
